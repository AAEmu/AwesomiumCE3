Awesomium Plugin for CryEngine SDK
=====================================
A completely new method of rendering Awesomium in CryEngine using D3D. 

This plugin has been almost completely rewritten from the original implementation.

Coherent UI plugin rendering code used as reference for D3D rendering.


Installation / Integration
==========================
Clone this repository to the "Code" directory. Add the project (project/Awesomium) to your CryEngine_GameCodeOnly solution.

It's recommended to use submodules if you're using Git for your Code directory versioning.

Make sure you have Plugin_D3D built the same way, along with Plugin_SDK.

The plugin manager will automatically load up the plugin when the game/editor is restarted or if you directly load it.
