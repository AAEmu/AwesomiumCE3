Awesomium Plugin for CryEngine SDK
=====================================
This was originally a plugin with a ton of spaghetti code to try and get Awesomium working in CE3.

I (kidovate) have forked the repository to clean up the code and try to get it to a more finished form.


Installation / Integration
==========================
Extract the files to your Cryengine SDK Folder so that the Code and BinXX/Plugins directory match up.

The plugin manager will automatically load up the plugin when the game/editor is restarted or if you directly load it.

CVars
